# My confguration files

This repo contains my personal configuration files so I can easily and quickly
set up any fresh-installed system with my favourite tools and appearance.

* `bash`: configurations for the bashrc shell.
* `codium`: contains the user setting for VSCodium.
* `conda`: contains an `environment.yml` for creating a `default` conda environment.
* `git`: contains global `.gitconfig` files
* `zsh`: configurations for the zsh shell.

`manjaro.md`, `yay.md` and `flatpak.md` are files that contain list of packages grouped in categories.
